# phase-0-gps-1

git clone = we used this to create a local copy of the repo on my hard drive based on what was in GitHub
touch = used to create new blank file
git status = checked to see if there are any changes, if they're tracked/staged, etc.
git add {filename} = adds new changes to be committed, makes them staged
git commit -m {"message"} = saving a snapshot of our changes, with a useful summary message of what the changes entailed
git push origin {branch name} = send the changes we've committed locally out to Github
git checkout -b {new-branch-name} = creating a new feature branch so we don't have to worry about messing up master with future changes

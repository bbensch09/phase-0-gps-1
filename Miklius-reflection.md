**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I was not aware of the formatting tricks with git, though I learned those from my pair during the session, and they are fairly straightforward. I also was slightly uncomfortable with the process of committing changes locally.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
Both of the aforementioned concepts were clarified completely. My peer demonstrated basic formatting in sublime as well as the step by step process of committing changes. After the session, I felt more confident in both areas.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I don't believe I had any specific questions for the guide other than a confirmation on what the navigator and driver do as far as their specific jobs. Aside from that, I asked my pair about various syntax questions regarding git, such as committing files and local requests.

**What still confuses you about git?**
The thing that still confuses me about git is how merge conflicts work. In addition to that, I don't fully get how the master branch should be treated regarding edits. What I mean by that is should the master branch only be changed by merging the changes of feature branches into it locally, or is there some other protocol to use?

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
My first experience pairing went very well. My pair was very patient and open to cooperation. We both had a good understanding of last week's work, so things went rather smoothly. Our instructor was fairly hands off, but jumped in when needed. If all my future pairings go this well, I would definitely be more than satisfied.

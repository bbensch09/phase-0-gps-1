##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  I felt pretty comfortable overall. I was less comfortable with the local merging, which I just hadn't practice much because generally we're merging from a local feature branch into the remote master on GitHub.
##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  The GPS clarified how to merge from local feature to local master with the command "git merge master", which we used in the conflict merging relaease. Also, in general having to navigate the driver and tell Chris exactly what commands to use definitely reinforced all of the core git commands.
##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  We had to ask our guide how to add a collaborator to a repo on GitHub. Turns out it was buried in Settings, and we probably would have spent another 5min poking around for it had she not told us, so that was very helpful.
##What still confuses you about git?
  I'm still a bit confused about how collaborating on an actual project will look in a real scenario. Assumedly we still have to delegate project pieces, because if I spontaneously start working on feature-like-button and my partner also creates a branch called feature-likes that more or less do the same things, we're going to run into conflicts. And so while I'm comfortable with how to review and track the changes/conflicts as they arise, I'm still not fully seeing how we as a team should efficiently divide up the work.
##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  It was great, I really enjoyed working with Chris. He was fully engaged, patient, clear and easy to understand, and I think we worked well together. Would be happy to pair with him again.
